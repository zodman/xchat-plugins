# The text formatting for the logger.
#
# The dict items correspond to Xchat Text Events:
# MESSAGE: Channel Msg Hilight
# ACTION: Channel Action Hilight
#
# Both of these must be defined.
#
# Values must be a tuple with 2 items, where the first
# item is the left hand side and the second the
# right hand side of the separator.
#
# Each value is used with the String formatting operator (%)
# with named mappings.

# The following information is available:
# - channel
# - time
# - mode
# - nick
# - text
# All of them are sent to both tuple items,
# and any of them can be omitted.

# IRC specific text formatting codes can be represented
# as specified:
#
# Type				HEX		OCT
# -----------------------------
# Bold				0x02	002
# Color				0x03	003  (with 2 digits after, f.ex. \00304 = color 4)

# Reverse/Italic	0x16	026
